## Step 1: Understanding the Weather Context

### Objective

To examine how temperature and solar irradiance affect solar farm output. This step establishes a foundational understanding of weather patterns so that downstream performance analysis reflects the true driving factors â€” not just surface-level trends.

### Why This Step Matters

Understanding weather patterns is important because it allows us to examine the relationship between weather variability and solar farm performance. It also helps determine whether dips in performance are due to natural conditions or hardware issues. Without this context, analysis risks drawing misaligned conclusions. The goal here is to build a weather-performance baseline that supports clearer detection of underperformance.
